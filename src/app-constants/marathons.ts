    review: `This was my 31st marathon and it was certainly one of the best, if not the best, marathon experience I've had.
    Don't necessarily expect to RUN a good time, but definitely expect to HAVE a good time at Disney!
    The Good:
    1) Disney Organization - 25,000 people for the Half followed by 25,000 more people in the Full the next day. Only Disney can pull off the organization of such a massive crowd with relatively few hassles. Sure there were some glitches - like standing wall to wall for many minutes in the pre-Start area before being allowed to walk to our Starting Corrals making many runners late for the start of the Half on Saturday. But guess what, on Sunday for the Full, problem largely resolved with an earlier release to the Starting Corrals. Staying at a Disney resort made transportation to and from the Start/Finish lines a breeze. Start and Finish areas were crowded but well-organized.
    2) The Disney Show - Nobody can entertain like Disney and this was evident throughout the Race Weekend. While waiting in the Starting Corrals we were entertained by racing legends Bill Rodgers, Frank Shorter, Dick Beardsley, Jeff Galloway and Disney legends Donald, Mickey and Goofy! Fireworks went off for the start of every single corral (not just for the first corral). Inspirational music was played throughout the course including Neil Diamond's surprisingly timeless Sweet Caroline which young and old sang together. Disney characters were omnipresent, available for photo ops throughout the entire course. Unusual entertainment like the kites that were waved by cast members above our heads as we ran by giving us (at least me) the illusion that I was almost flying. The spectacular characters and of course Mickey, Donald and Goofy again at Mile 20 in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the marathon.
    3) The Course - Wow! Running through 6 Disney attractions - Magic Kingdom, Disney World Speedway, Animal Kingdom, Champion Stadium (spring training home of the Atlanta Braves), Hollywood Studios, and Epcot. First, Magic Kingdom - it's still dark when runners get to this park so the lights of Main Street and Cinderella's castle are spectacular. Combine that with the massive number of spectators lining Main Street and you have an experience rivaling New York City, Boston or Chicago. Speedway - running around a race track has the potential of being boring but all kinds of car enthusiasts brought their vintage cars for us to look at - fascinating. Animal Kingdom - very earth- friendly animal trainers brought out animals onto the course so that they we could gawk at them and they at us. Champion Stadium - running around the race track with your name announced as you ran down the first base line and your image appeared on the centerfield jumbotron! Hollywood Studios - I never thought I would run to New York New York again after the NYC Marathon but got the opportunity once more as I ran in a mock version of NYC. Epcot - where else will you get to run in France, Morocco, Japan, Italy, Germany, China, Norway and Mexico in less than a mile?! AND it happens to be the LAST mile of the race!

    In the past, a lot has been said about all the service roads that have to be run to get to the various parks but there
    is plenty of entertainment there as well. And an occasional quiet break from all the bedlam in the parks is
    sometimes good for us and allows us to remind ourselves what running is all about.

    The Bad:
    Not much at all except unfortunately the etiquette of fellow runners. The race is big and maybe too big. The field never really thins out either. Sometimes the course just cannot accommodate all the runners. Running etiquette is of prime importance. Disney realizes this and distributes running manners in the official race handbook, but unfortunately many of our colleagues don't read them or read them and ignore them. There are some examples of excellent etiquette like the runner who was immediately ahead of me on a narrow stretch who signaled with an upward motion of her arm that she was about to stop allowing me to adjust. But this was the exception. Newbies (and there are a lot of newbies at Disney) and unfortunately even grizzled veterans (read Marathon Maniacs) would occasionally exhibit bad behavior by cutting runners off around corners, squeezing into spaces which were not meant to be squeezed into, stopping suddenly without warning, shouting and cursing (dropping the F-bomb even!).

    But besides these isolated individuals, the field is largely well behaved, excited, pumped up and friendly.
    Overall, the Disney marathon is simply spectacular and an experience that will be a life-long memory!`,

    review: `Although I left Ogden satisfied that I had completed one of the most mentally tough marathons of my 33, I had a profound sense of disappointment as well. Ninety-five percent of my disappointment was out of the hands of the organizers and everybody else because Mother Nature decided that it was time to soak Ogden, Eden, Huntsville and the entire course with an unrelenting and cold rain on Marathon Day. Hence, my disappointment, I chose Ogden because it is billed as one of the most beautiful marathon courses in the country. And although I still saw most of this beauty with roaring streams and waterfalls and steep canyons and the fog dancing in the hills, the true grandeur of my surroundings (the snow-capped peaks, the blue water of Pineview reservoir, the morning light glowing through the tall trees) was unfortunately lost. Let me make myself perfectly clear, this was obviously no fault of the race organizers, but still a disappointment.

    On the other hand, the conditions made for a mentally tough race which was very satisfying to complete. Constant cold rain for 26 miles takes its toll even when appropriately dressed. It's just plain hard to stay dry and warm in those type of conditions. And then there's my best friend who, while we were running together, enjoyed sharing the story by science fiction writer, Ray Bradbury, of astronauts trapped on Venus where it was constantly raining and they ultimately commit suicide because they can no longer stand the rain!

    Getting back to the remaining 5% disappointment: I have to lay this on the race organizers. Although they did their best, I feel they were significantly ill-prepared for the conditions. Yes, they kept us nice and warm at the starting line with the fire pits - a nice touch. But there was a major problem at the Finish Area. After running 26 miles in these conditions and suddenly stopping with continued rain and cold, there is a significant risk of hypothermia. Although I saw a few space blankets on some runners, the crew either ran out of them or at the very best didn't make them very prominent. There was no warm-up tent or equipment that is common in other marathons. We were left to fend on our own. I know my body temperature had significantly dropped - it took me an hour to stop shivering even back in my toasty hotel room under the blankets of my bed. My friend experienced the same. I heard that the Ogden Marathon has enjoyed excellent weather for 11 of its now 13 runnings but I hope the organizers take 2013 as a lesson and become better prepared for inclement weather in the future.

    Other thoughts:
    1) Nice but not spectacular finisher's medal
    2) Bus rides to start were easy and seamless
    3) The pre-start runner's holding area was a pasture that had been used by cows...beware of cow pies!
    4) Volunteers are wonderful and nice
    5) Gear pick-up at Finish Line was easy - fortunately so, I had to get into some warm dry clothes STAT!
    6) Bus pick-up and Finish Line are very close to hotels.
    7) 25th Street (Finish Line) is a blast!`,

    review: `The Kona Marathon provides a nice option for a summer marathon in Hawaii. Sure there were logistic issues but these could all be blamed on having to adjust to a new course route which required the organizers to:
    1) Employ a bus for shuttling
    2) Come up with a new finish area for the Finish Line.

    Based on the past history of these organizers, I'm optimistic that they will learn from this experience and ensure they have reliable shuttles and realize it is not advisable to be running up and down hotel stairs at mile 26. Besides I think we runners should accept that we are not running Boston and that we are indeed in Hawaii and embrace the 'Hang Loose' mentality and give the organizers some slack.

    Here are some real positives about this race:
    1) You will get to brag that you have run a large part of the same marathon that the Ironman Triathalon athletes run AND that you did it in the heat of summer whereas those wussy triathletes do it in the relative coolness of October!
    2) The finisher's medal is the most beautiful of the 34 marathon medals I've received so far - it should be rated in the top 10 of Marathon and Beyond's Top Finishing Medals
    3) The pasta dinner is well done - outside with Hawaiian entertainment, cloth tablecloths, delicious array of food
    4) The volunteers are awesome
    5) Water stations that were consistently supplied with a tremendous amount of ice - a rare finding for a marathon
    6) You're running in Hawaii!!!!`,

    review: `The runner's comments of 2012 had me concerned so I emailed Sean, the Race Director, before the race. He claimed that the comments were either wrong or had all been corrected.

    He was SO right! Although my finish time was slow, this turned out to be one of my most favortie marathons of the 35 I have run.

    Positives:
    1) Packet pick-up was a breeze - would have took seconds except I stayed and chatted with the friendly volunteers
    2) No Start Line hassles - my wife drove me to withing 50 feet of the Start Line!, uncrowded flush toilets, easy bag drop off
    3) THE COURSE IS BEAUTIFUL - on the Rio Grande Trail almost all of it follows the Roaring Fork River, starts in shaded pine and aspen groves; then traverses over open mesas affording views of the hills and mountains of Aspen valley, dropping about 1400 feet into the small welcoming town of Basalt. The trail is mostly paved with some hard-pack dirt/gravel (ideal, soft running surface). There are mountains and hills to gaze at, pine forests to smell, and rapids and waterfalls to hear. Simply beautiful.
    4) The volunteers - very friendly
    5) The finisher's medal - it's great. Not the biggest but maybe the most elegant. A silver medal Aspen leaf with the words 'Aspen Valley Marathon' imprinted on it. Just perfect!
    6) The Finish Line - although I was in no shape to partake, the amenities of a glass of champagne and the salad bar as well as beer on tap were a very nice touch.

    Negatives - I really can't think of any. If forced to name some:
    1) Lack of spectators - but this allows you to enjoy the beauty of the surroundings even more!
    2) Lack of expo - I didn't miss it!
    3) Altitude may have an effect on sea-level dwellers.

    This marathon is probably one of the best if not the best that I have run. I highly recommend it.`,

    review: `Detroit was my 36th marathon and my 18th state. It turned out to be one of my favorites! Detroit is a really beautiful city and the marathon makes sure that the runners realize this. From the beautiful sunrise over Canada as we crossed the Ambassador Bridge, to actually running across the border, to the riverside run in Windsor, to the tunnel back into the United States, to English Village homes, to Belle Isle...what a wonderful experience. One of the most scenic marathons I've ever run!
    And the finishing medal is one of the most unique I've collected.

    Hint: if coming from out of town, stay at the Double Tree - it is literally a half block from the Start/Finish line allowing one to stay warm and get bathroom activities done literally right before the Start Gun and allowing one to have minimal distance to hobble after the race to get to that welcome shower!
    Moreover, if taking the family the Henry Ford Museum was great fascinating fun and there are numerous corn mazes in the suburbs of Michigan at this time of year

    review: `This was my 37th marathon and my 19th state. The Philadelphia marathon is good but not great. It was a yin/yang experience actually:

    Pros
    The course - first half through the city past the historical sites and the canyons of buildings echoing the cheers of the crowds, an opportunity to get energized - fantastic. The second half a completely different experience - quiet, bucolic, an opportunity to reflect - also fantastic.
    Start/Finish - at the base of the Rocky steps - can't get much better than that!
    Expo - wide, uncramped aisles
    The Medal - huge

    Cons
    The course - it will test your marathon 'metal' to be so close but yet so far away from the Finish at the halfway mark and then to run that 6.5 mile out and back seeing all the runners ahead of you, realizing you have to retrace every single step you take out as you come back. Marathons are supposed to be not only physically tough but mentally tough - Philly will no doubt challenge your mental toughness.
    Start/Finish - as previously said, I too haven't seen such long lines for the Portalets. Also you are so close to the Rocky steps but you are fenced in for security reasons so it is a bit of challenge to get to the Rocky statue and steps - I made sure I made the visit the day before
    The Medal - huge but nothing special especially for the 2oth anniversary. Why not take a lesson from Detroit or Cincinnati which highlight better the unique aspects of their cities?
    Water stations - on only one side of the road which often made it impossible to get to if one was running on the opposite side.
    Request for 5AM runner arrival - It's bad enough to ask us to arrive this early, another to deny access to the start area for another 20 minutes or so. Not sure that all the effort afforded a feeling of a tremendous increase in security.

    Expo - need better signage as to where the packet pickup is`,

    review: `Top 10 Reasons why this marathon (my 38th) is one of my most favorites:
    1) Title sponsor is Garmin so the organizers are able to bring him big name, Garmin-sponsored elite runners to speak and mingle with interested participants at the Pasta Dinner. This year the guest was Meb Keflezighi, US Olympian, winner of NYC marathon and this year's Boston Marathon winner! Now, how absolutely cool is THAT!!!
    2) Photos and autographs with Meb!    3) A true Oz experience: fellow runners really getting into the theme dressed as Scarecrow, Lion, Tin Man, Flying Monkeys, Witches. (In what other marathon, can you experience
    5 Dorothy's pass you!). A yellow brick road finish line. Aid station volunteers in full costume.
    4) Gutsy race director - heavy downpour with thunder and lightening for the second hour of the race, yet no cancellation! Turned out to be the right move, the weather cleared and the rest of the day was beautiful. But boy oh boy was that hour of thunder, lightening and black skies harrowing - almost like the first part of the movie!!
    5) Cool medal - this year: the lion in front of the yellow brick road and Emerald City.
    6) Cool shirt - this year: the lion with the word 'Courage' above his picture in navy blue with gold letters
    7) Nice 'pasta' dinner - not truely pasta but nevertheless delicious
    8) Small size - my wife and I were together at the start line until the gun went off - can't do that in Boston, New York, Chicago, etc.
    9) Pretty course - miles 15-25 are on a bike trail along a creek. This year it got a little bit muddy (because of the earlier rain) in portions but not a big problem. Just made our journey to the 'Emerald City' more fun!
    10) Pretty flat course - some very very small hills but this IS Kansas and this course is basically flat. A runner can have a fast time on this course (even though I personally couldn't follow through on that claim!).`,

    review: `Top 10 Bests
    1) Yes, it was bitterly cold but once we got running, not bad at all
    2) An authentic running experience - not many spectators and on portions of this course you will be alone
    3) Beautiful scenery - rounding the big bend at mile 9-10 and looking at the Maryland hills was extraordinary
    4) You get to run through a train tunnel
    5) The start line is right next to your hotel room
    6) The finish line is therefore right next to your hotel room as well!
    7) The course running surface is finely ground gravel/dirt - very soft on your legs
    8) The long incline from miles 6-16 isn't very steep and not that bad at all
    9) The last 6 miles are a gentle downhill
    10) If you can somehow manage to afford it, Nemacolin Resort makes for a great post-race splurge!`,

    Top Ten Features of the Fargo Marathon:
    10) I never saw any nefarious activity around wood chippers!
    9) Fargo airport - simple, no-hassle
    8) Expo - grand scale for small town
    7) The Community - really gets behind all of the weekend events.
    6) T-shirt - technical, long sleeve, zipper, classy
    5) Hotels - many hotels immediately adjacent to start and finish making race day logistics easy. The Day's Inn provided free bottles of water, protein and granola bars to their guests throughout the weekend
    4) Fargodome - the start and finish of the race were inside this indoor football stadium for the North Dakota State Bison football team. Kept us toasty warm and protected from the wind chills in the 20's at race start
    3) Finisher's Medal - unique to Fargo - modeled after the iconic Fargo Theater - nice choice!
    2) Deena Kastor - was a guest speaker and gave an inspirational speech the day before the race
    1) The course - mostly (but not entirely) flat, runs through three beautiful and unique college campuses and multiple parks - beautiful. And ends in the Fargodome with your finish displayed on its Jumbotron!

    10) Just getting there is a beautiful adventure - For most runners, Waitsfield isn't exactly a short jaunt, but that's OK because to get to Waitsfield you will most likely take one or two of the many scenic byways of Vermont - absolutely gorgeous
    9) The Shirt - a beautiful tech shirt with the Mad Marathon logo emblazoned on the front - one of my most favorite shirts
    8) The Finisher's Medal - perfect memento of Vermont - just what a 50 state marathoner wants
    7) Vermont hospitality - from the race volunteers, to Dori, the race director, to our hosts Peter and Susan at the West Hill House Bed and Breakfast - unparalleled. For instance, Susan at our B and B made a complimentary sumptuous carb loading spread the evening before the race for all the marathoners staying there AND she woke up on race morning to serve us a small breakfast at 5AM!
    6) Waitsfield Farmer's Market on Saturday morning - truly a Vermont experience
    5) The Hug from Dori as you cross the finish line
    4) Running through Covered Bridges - you don't have this type of experience in NYC, Boston, Chicago!
    3) The hose at mile 23 - a local resident ran a hose from their house to the street and allowed racers to douse themselves with refreshingly cold water - much needed on this 85 degree day
    2) To say you conquered the hill at mile 22.5 - it's short but steep and even steeper at this stage of the race - they call it the Cabot Cheese Dip - more like the Cabot Cheese Abyss

    review: `First, the positives:
    1) This course is absolutely beautiful. My wife and I drove the course the day before and were just exhilarated by its beauty. I could hardly wait to run it the next day.
    2) Just getting to the course is a wonderful experience - for an out of towner like me, it was a beautiful drive past the massive and impressive Mt Rainier.
    3) The timing of this race in mid-late October makes for spectacular Fall colors.
    4) This location is truly an escape - no shopping malls, sketchy internet service - just you and the beautiful mountains.

    Unfortunately, some negatives:
    1) First and foremost, I did not feel safe. Highway 12 is a 2 lane winding highway with a lot of traffic which is not stopped during the race. Speed limits on this highway are often as high as 55 mph and cars are speeding faster than that. There are not only cars but a heavy semi-truck presence. Runners run on the shoulder with traffic. The shoulder can be narrow, sometimes non-existent. Cars from the opposite direction can veer into the lane closest to you to pass slower traffic. This is extremely disconcerting to see two cars bearing down on you - one in the opposite lane and another screaming inches away from you in the lane next to your shoulder. During the later miles, things can be particularly precarious as runner's gaits become less reliable, more unsteady. The possibility of tripping and falling into traffic is real. The traffic and safety issues became so disconcerting to me that it was frequently impossible to enjoy the tremendous beauty surrounding me.
    2) Not that I expected a medal the size of Little Rock's, but the medal here is pretty pathetic.
    3) Not that I expected the grandeur of NYC, but the Finish Line here is merely a digital clock.

    In summary, although the race organizers are wonderful people doing the best they can in a beautiful area, there are serious safety issues that need to be addressed before I could recommend this marathon to fellow runners.`,

    10) Runners aren't usually an extravagant bunch but if you are willing to splurge, The Sanctuary is an ideal spot to stay - yards from the expo, finish and start lines.
    9) Again, if you are willing to splurge and a golfer, a bucket list experience is playing the Ocean Course - I had it to myself on the morning before the marathon!
    8) Brilliant sunrises.
    7) Brilliant sunsets.
    6) A family experience all around but made especially so by the organizers (e.g. the Friday evening Glow Run on the beach).
    5) Christmas decorations at The Sanctuary.
    4) Plenty of restaurant options on-island.
    3) This was my 50th marathon and probably the flattest - this makes up (in part) for those terrible out and backs.
    2) Beautiful course

    10 - No lack of outstanding restaurants to have a delicious carb-loading meal the night before the race

    8- Running along tree-lined St. Charles Avenue  a very pleasant, mellow kind of experience
    7- Running along Decatur Street in front of Jackson Square, St. Louis Cathedral and Café du Monde with music blaring  a quintessential New Orleans experience
    6 - Viewing at the Expo all of the special (and sometimes outrageous) medals RNR offers for runners participating in 2 or more RNR races in a year
    5 - Staggered start of all 33 corrals gives even us back-of-the-packers the feeling that we are the race leaders as we run down Poydras Avenue with no visible runners ahead of us at race start.
    4- Attending mass at St. Louis Cathedral on Saturday evening where the priest informed us that since he gave up alcohol for Lent that we should have a few drinks for him!
    3 - The sound system set-ups along Jackson Square and along Lake Pontchartrain where the DJs set up speakers which extended for nearly a mile along the race course.
    2 - Part of the course is below sea level & so if altitudes above sea level deprive runners of oxygen, do we gain oxygen if we run below sea level??!!!

    9) Just the right size of race - no problem getting into your groove pace from the outset.
    8) A few of the people that cheered us on the course - A Santa shouting Merry Marathon, an elegant lady in a 19th century ball gown exclaiming, Excellent run, My Lord! Both doing so in the drenching rain!
    7) Every runners name and home town are announced while crossing the Finish Line.

    10) A nice escape from the mid June heat/humidity of the lower 48..its like natural air-conditioning.
    9) The hills are largely at the beginning except for the last one right before the Finish Line which you actually get to run twice in the last half mile!
    8) You can make a wonderful vacation out of running it
    7) Since this is a true destination race, there are a lot of hardcore runners with some good inspirational stories  a 50-stater was finishing his 50th state, another was doing the 50 states for the 3rd time.
    6) A variety of running surfaces  streets, bike paths, crushed gravel/dirt roads, single track trail and even grass (at the finish line)
    5) Corollary to #6, the race is run on city streets for less than a mile total&this makes for a more pure running experience
    4) Although you dont get a participant shirt, you do get a really nice long-sleeved technical shirt at the Finish Line
    3) The finishers medal is great  it even has a moose on the back
    2) One of the most beautiful marathons Ive run  mountains, creeks, rivers, meadows, ponds, the inlet, flowers, forests&absolutely gorgeous

    5) The two out and back hilly spurs off the main flat bike path route keep the race from being boring.
    4) Successfully avoiding the 26 mile long minefield of slugs that had made their way on the bike path on the rainy day before the race (didn't squish a one!)

    8) To help Mr. DeFronzo from getting lost on the course - he has a notoriously bad sense of direction!
    7) To be cheered by Ivelisse - the race director who is passionate about the race and its runners. She'll give you a loud "WooHoo" cheer on every one of your laps.
    6) To be moved by the 14 y.o. violinist playing pre-race National Anthem
    5) To decode the on-line course map. It could be used as a puzzle for Mensa membership. In person it's not as complicated as it may seem
    4) To be prayed for by Ivelisse's friend before the race start - there was a 100% chance of rain, he prayed for no rain and at most we had a few minutes of a very light drizzle!
